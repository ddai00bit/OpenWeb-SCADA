## Features (Current Roadmap and Future Plans)

1. Appliware - Web-based framework for hardware sub-module monitoring.<br />
2. ClientDesk - Customer relations system with ticket managing and purchases integration.<br />
3. Unidev - Deployment of platforms, internal modules, mysql table monitoring and error log / FTP log reading.
4. Module-based permissions and sandboxing.
5. Single-user and multi-user permissions and categorization.
6. OpenWeb SCADA Notification API for user notifications.
7. Module standardization (ex. uniform jQuery version) enforcement to reduce breakage of modules.
